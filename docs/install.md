# Installation of pontos

## Requirements

Python 3.7 and later is supported.

## Using pip

pip 19.0 or later is required.

You can install the latest stable release of **pontos** from the Python
Package Index (pypi) using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

```shell
python3 -m pip install --user pontos
```

## Using poetry

Because **pontos** is a Python library you most likely need a tool to
handle Python package dependencies and Python environments. Therefore we
strongly recommend using [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) or [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

You can install the latest stable release of **pontos** and add it as
a dependency for your current project using [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)

```shell
poetry add pontos
```

For installation via pipenv please take a look at their [documentation](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/).
